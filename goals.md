Goals, objectives, tasks, things to do...

At the moment, I am very happy with my progress so far.
I got the Python script to do what I wanated it to do.
And that was.
To recognize the number that turned up.
This uses the 
pyautogui.locateOnScreen
pyautogui.locateCenterOnScreen
pyautogui.pixel
pyautogui.pixelMatchesColor
To locate the image on the screen.
If it finds the image.
It put the image number into the lists.
It also highlights the image number on the window.

When the Roulette window is open.
If it has a yellow area on it.
It does a free spin.

Spin, Spins the wheel.
Locates the current number.
And displays it.

That's all it does so far...

Things to do...
Work out how to do Classes.
Work out how to do bets.
How to do cash flow.

Goals...
Work out how to do bets.
How to do cash flow.
Ad in a random function.
To test out how well it peforms with random numbers.

Long term goals...
See if I can figure out how to add in AI into the script.

Things I am stuck on...???
Classes.
While and For loops.
Math
(for adition and subtraction in the script.)
