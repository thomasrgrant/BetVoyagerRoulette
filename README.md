Tom's BetVoyager No ZERO (no flash) Roulette Bot GUI made in Python				
																												
Created and writen by Thomas Grant. https://www.facebook.com/thomasrgrant/										
																												
Created: 02/12/2020 written in Sublime and Notepad ++															
Used Snagit for and pyautogui for screen capture.																
																												
Purpose: To play roulette on BetVoyager No ZERO roulette tables.												
To match the icoming number. And see if can find it on the screen												
To eventually place bets and see if it can win. Using different methods.										
Possibly use AI to test out betting methods. To see what is the best bet to make.								
And add any other ideas as I go along...																		


NOTES:

NOTE: BetVoyager No ZERO (no flash) in FireFox. 
As if you leave chrome alone. The screen blanks out. 
And you have to reaload the page again.

NOTE: All x, y positons are for Firefox with the menu bar open in 100% view mode.
Once the BetVoyager download works. I will be working from there.
