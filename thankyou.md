"Hi thomasrgrant,
a3du114h left you messages:
Is this really a project made by someone who just started learning Python?
Man if this is, you definitely are a genius
Yes. The most I made is a 250 lines long script. 
If you made that there is more I could learn from you than you from me (not even joking)"
